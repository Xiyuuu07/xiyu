Hi! I am **Xiyu Cao**, a junior researcher in communication at the University of Macau. My work explores digital platforms, intimacy, and infrastructures to capture the patterns, mechanisms, and dynamics of how we live with technology.

## Research Focus

I am especially interested in how our emotional life and forms of intimacy are technologically mediated and increasingly platformized. Using multiple qualitative research methods and engaging in theoretical construction, my research spans multiple dimensions of how platforms are interwoven into everyday life and shape our interactions and practices.

## Current Research Areas

- **Platform Studies**: Examining how digital platforms mediate human relationships and everyday life
- **Digital Intimacy**: Exploring how technology shapes emotional connections, including dating and mourning, and their performances on the platforms.
- **Infrastructure Studies**: Understanding the material and social dimensions of digital infrastructures in contemporary China
- **Qualitative Methods**: Employing ethnographic, interview-based research, narrative and discourse approaches
